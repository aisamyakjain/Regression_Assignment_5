    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  Elastic Net Regression combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms, allowing for both feature selection and handling multicollinearity. It balances the advantages of both methods."

    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The optimal values of the regularization parameters (alpha and lambda) in Elastic Net Regression can be chosen using techniques like cross-validation or grid search to minimize error or maximize performance metrics."

    "\n",
    "Answer: Advantages: Elastic Net Regression handles multicollinearity, performs feature selection, and provides a balance between Lasso and Ridge regression.\n",
    "Disadvantages: It introduces additional hyperparameters and can be computationally expensive compared to individual Lasso or Ridge regression."
